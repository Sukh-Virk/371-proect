## **1\. Project Overview & Description**

This project is a secure, multi-user chat application built using Python's Socket API (TCP) for backend communication and React with WebSockets for the frontend interface. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central Python server, register with unique usernames, and exchange private messages with other online users in real-time. The system features end-to-end message encryption using a shared password, ensuring that message content remains confidential even if intercepted. The architecture consists of three layers: a Python server managing user sessions and message routing, a Node.js WebSocket server that bridges the React frontend with the Python client processes, and a React-based GUI that provides a modern, responsive chat experience. The server handles user authentication, maintains real-time user lists, validates message formats, and ensures that messages are only delivered to intended recipients, preventing unauthorized access or message interception.

## **2\. System Limitations & Edge Cases**

As required by the project specifications, we have identified and handled (or defined) the following limitations and potential issues within our application scope:

* **Cross-Layer Communication & Process Management:**
  * <span style="color: green;">*Solution:*</span> We established a three-tier architecture where the React frontend communicates via WebSocket to a Node.js server, which spawns individual Python client processes. Each Python client maintains a persistent TCP connection to the central Python server. The Node.js server acts as a bidirectional bridge, forwarding messages between the browser and Python processes while managing process lifecycle and stdout/stderr buffering.

   * <span style="color: red;">*Limitation:*</span> Process spawning introduces latency and resource overhead per connection. In a high-traffic scenario, the Node.js server would need to implement connection pooling, reuse Python processes, or consider a unified WebSocket-native Python backend to eliminate the intermediary process layer.
 
* **User State Management & Consistency:**
  * <span style="color: green;">*Solution:*</span> The Python server maintains a centralized dictionary of connected clients and their associated connection objects. When users join or leave, the server broadcasts the updated user list to all connected clients, ensuring consistency across the distributed system. The React frontend updates its UI immediately upon receiving these broadcasts

   * <span style="color: red;">*Limitation:*</span> If a client disconnects abruptly (e.g., network failure, browser crash), the server may not immediately detect the disconnection until the TCP keepalive timeout occurs. This can result in stale user entries being displayed to other clients temporarily. A production implementation would require TCP keepalive settings or periodic heartbeat messages to detect stale connections more aggressively
 
* **Message Encryption & Data Privacy:**
  * <span style="color: green;">*Solution:*</span> We integrated encryption functionality using a shared password that both communicating parties must know. Messages are encrypted on the client side before transmission and decrypted on the receiving client, ensuring that even if network traffic is intercepted, message contents remain confidential.
    
  * <span style="color: red;">*Limitation:*</span> The encryption key (shared password) is transmitted once during initial connection and stored in memory on both the Python client and server. A more secure implementation would use public-key cryptography to establish session keys without exposing the shared secret, and implement proper key rotation mechanisms.
 
* **Input Validation & Security:** 
  * <span style="color: green;">*Solution:*</span> We implemented validation at multiple levels to prevent malformed data from crashing the system. The React frontend isables message sending when no recipient is selected or message is empty, preventing invalid WebSocket messages. The Python client validates message format (/msg recipient message) before sending to server, catching malformed commands, and the Python server verifies that incoming JSON payloads contain required fields (type, username, to, payload) before processing, and gracefully ignores malformed messages.

  * <span style="color: red;">*Limitation:*</span> While we validate message structure, we do not implement message rate limiting, content filtering, or flood protection. A malicious user could theoretically spam the server with rapid messages, consuming resources. Additionally, message encryption is implemented but the shared password is transmitted in plaintext during initial connection, which would require TLS/SSL for proper production deployment.

## **4\. Prerequisites (Fresh Environment)**

To run this project, you need:

* **Python 3.10** or higher.  
* No external pip installations are required (uses standard socket, threading, json, sys libraries).  
* (Optional) VS Code or Terminal.

<span style="color: purple;">***RUBRIC NOTE: No external libraries are required. Therefore, a requirements.txt file is not strictly necessary for dependency installation, though one might be included for environment completeness.***</span>

### **Step 1: Start the Server**

Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder. The server binds to 127.0.0.1 on port 5050\.  
```bash
python server.py  
# Console output: "[STARTING] Server is listening on 127.0.0.1:5050"
```

### **Step 2: Connect Player 1 (X)**

Open a **new** terminal window (keep the server running). Run the client script to start the first client.  
```bash
python client.py  
# Console output: "Connected. Waiting for opponent..."
```

### **Step 3: Connect Player 2 (O)**

Open a **third** terminal window. Run the client script again to start the second client.  
```bash
python client.py  
# Console output: "Connected. Waiting for opponent..."
# Console output: "Match found! You are Player O."
```

### **Step 4: Gameplay**

1. **Player X** will be prompted: Enter row and col (e.g., '1 1'):.  
2. Type two numbers separated by a space (from 0 to 2\) and press Enter.  
3. The server updates the board on both screens.  
4. **Player O** takes their turn.  
5. The connection naturally terminates when a win/draw is achieved.

## **5\. Technical Protocol Details (JSON over TCP & Inter-Process Communication)**

We designed a custom application-layer protocol for data exchange across three distinct communication channels: JSON over TCP between Python client and Python server, WebSocket messaging between React frontend and Node.js server, and stdin/stdout piping between Node.js and Python client processes.

### Layer 1: Python Client ↔ Python Server (TCP/JSON Protocol) 

* **Message Format:** `{"type": <string>, "<fields>": <data>}`  
* **Handshake Phase:**
  * Client sends: `{"type": "register", "username": "Alice"}`
  * Server responds (success): `{"type": "register_ok"}`
  * Server responds (error): `{"type": "error", "message": "Username taken"}`
* **User Management Phase:**  
  * Client sends: `{"type": "user_list"}`  
  * Server broadcasts: `{"type": "user_list"}`
 * **Messaging Phase:**
   * Client sends: `{"type": "message", "to": "Bob", "payload": "Hello!"}`
   * Server forwards to recipient: (success): `{"type": "message", "from": "Alice", "payload": "Hello!"}`
   * Server responds (error): `{"type": "error", "message": "User not found"}`

### Layer 2: Node.js ↔ Python Client (stdin/stdout Process Communication)

* **Message Format:** Text-based commands (stdin) and formatted strings (stdout).
* **Handshake Phase:**
  * Node.js sends (stdin): `<username>`
  * Node.js sends (stdin): `<password>`
  * Python responds (stdout, success): `"Registered"`
  * Python responds (stdout, error): `"Error: Username taken"`
* **User Management Phase:**  
   * Node.js sends (stdin): `"/users"`  
   * Python responds (stdout): `"Users: Alice, Bob, Charlie"`
 * **Messaging Phase:**
   * Node.js sends (stdin): `"/msg Bob Hello!"` 
   * Python forwards received message (stdout, success): `"Alice: Hello!"`
   * Python responds (stdout, error): `"Error: User not found"`

### Layer 3: React ↔ Node.js (WebSocket Protocol)

* **Message Format:** Text commands and responses.
* **Handshake Phase:**
  * React sends: `<username>`
  * React sends: `<password>`
  * Node.js responds (success): `"Registered"`
  * Node.js response (error): `"Error: Username taken"`
* **User Management Phase:**  
  * React sends: `"/users"`  
  * Node.js responds: `"Users: Alice, Bob, Charlie"`
 * **Messaging Phase:**
   * React sends: `"/msg Bob Hello!"` 
   * Node.js forwards incoming message (success): `"Alice: Hello!"`
   * Node.js responds (error): `"Error: User not found"`
